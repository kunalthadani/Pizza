# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

the login.html and register.html files are html files allowing users to login and register.
there are 6 different html files (dinner.html, reg_pizza.html, salads.html, sic_pizza.html, subs.html and pasta.html) allow users to add an item from that sub category.
orders.html gives the admins a list of all orders
confirm.html is a page where the user confirms his order before placing it
previous.html lists all the previous orders placed by the user

My addition feature is that a user can see all the orders he has placed before on a seperate page.
